### Introduction

The Slatebox API is a server-side API available to Slatebox PRO teams. The API lets you interact with your organization's slates programmatically, as well as manage your organization and its members. With a single prompt, you can produce editable slates for your users, programmatically integrating Slatebox visualizations with your own ecosystem.

Currently, the Slatebox API is available in private beta to PRO members. [Please sign up to get free access](https://form.jotform.com/231197009478058)!
