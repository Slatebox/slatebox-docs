Slatebox has two distinct licenses for its code, both of which are free and open for your hacking pleasure. The Slatebox app is the full slatebox.com experience, available to run on your own server. Slateboxjs is the underlying diagramming, mind-mapping, and visualization library used at Slatebox.com.

!!! [Slatebox App Development](./development.md)
The same code that powers Slatebox.com is available under the Elastic 2.0 License (Elv2) and is free and open for anyone to use and extend. You're welcome to use Slatebox for your own company's needs, host on your own servers, and use it in your own application as well, provided you adhere to the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license" target="_blank">three simple limitations in the license</a>.

To set up your development environment to run and modify the Slatebox App, start with [Slatebox App Development](./development.md)!
!!!
!!! [Slateboxjs API](./slateboxjs-api.md)
Slateboxjs is an open source, MIT-licensed low-level <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slateboxjs" target="_blank">npm module</a> that powers all the collaborative visuals at slatebox.com.

Not sure which to use? The Slatebox development guide will get the Slatebox.com app running on your machine quickly. Slateboxjs is a lower level module that allows programmatic control of "slates" -- the library itself is included in the Slatebox App.
